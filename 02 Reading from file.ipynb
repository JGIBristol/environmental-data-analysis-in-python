    "\n",
    "One of the most common situations is that you have a data file containing the data you want to read. Perhaps this is data you've produced yourself or maybe it's from a colleague or perhaps from an online source. In an ideal world the file will be perfectly formatted and will be trivial to import into pandas but since this is so often not the case, pandas provides a number of features to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full information on reading and writing is available in the pandas manual on [IO tools](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) but first it's worth noting the common formats that pandas can work with:\n",
    "- Comma separated tables (or tab-separated or space-separated etc.)\n",
    "- Excel spreadsheets\n",
    "- HDF5 files\n",
    "- SQL databases\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course we will focus on plain-text CSV files as they are perhaps the most common format. It's also common to be provided with data in an Excel format and Pandas provides all the tools you need to extract the data out of Excel and analyse it in Python."

This contains some historical weather data for a location in the UK. Import that file as a Pandas `DataFrame` using `read_csv()`, making sure that you set the index column, skip the appropriate rows, separate the columns correctly and cover all the possible NaN values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: This data is a little tricky to deal with as it uses spaces to separate its columns. You can't just use `sep=\" \"` as that will assume that a _single_ space is the separator. Instead of using `sep` at all, you need to tell it to use _whitespace_ (e.g. spaces, tabs, etc.) as the _delimiter_ (search the documentation for an appropriate argument).\n",
