    "\n",
    "One of the most common situations is that you have a data file containing the data you want to read. Perhaps this is data you've produced yourself or maybe it's from a colleague or perhaps from an online source. In an ideal world the file will be perfectly formatted and will be trivial to import into pandas but since this is so often not the case, pandas provides a number of features to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full information on reading and writing is available in the pandas manual on [IO tools](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) but first it's worth noting the common formats that pandas can work with:\n",
    "- Comma separated tables (or tab-separated or space-separated etc.)\n",
    "- Excel spreadsheets\n",
    "- HDF5 files\n",
    "- SQL databases\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course we will focus on plain-text CSV files as they are perhaps the most common format. It's also common to be provided with data in an Excel format and Pandas provides all the tools you need to extract the data out of Excel and analyse it in Python."
